This repository contains the source code for a fun and engaging memory card game built with Flutter. The goal of the game is to match pairs of cards with the same image, while trying to remember where each card is located.

## Features

- **Flippable Cards:** Experience the true essence of a memory game with cards that flip when you tap them.
- **Progress Tracking:** Keep track of your matches and attempts, with an in-game scoreboard.
- **Rotatable Widgets:** Enjoy a dynamic and interactive user interface, with widgets that rotate.
- **Beautiful Graphics:** Delight in the eye-catching card designs and smooth animations.
- **Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms.

## How to Play

The gameplay is simple and intuitive:

1. Cards are laid out in a grid face down.
2. Players take turns flipping pairs of cards over.
3. If the two cards match, the player scores one point, the two cards are removed from the game.
4. If they do not match, the cards are turned back over.
5. The game ends when all the cards have been matched.
